## Original Project
scikit-aero was originally created by Juan Luis Cano in 2012 as a Python package for aeronautical engineering calculations. The original implementation provided the foundation for:

- Basic project structure
- COESA atmosphere model implementation
- Isentropic flow calculations
- Normal shock relations

## Major Rewrite (2024)
The project was completely rewritten by Andrew James Doty and Dennis Hom to:

- Modernize the codebase
- Add comprehensive parametric aircraft design capabilities
- Implement Raymer's design equations
- Update to modern Python practices and tooling
